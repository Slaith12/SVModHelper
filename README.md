# SVModHelper
StarVaders Mod Helper is a mod manager/library that helps with developing mods for the game StarVaders, made by Pengonauts. It provides various functions to allow modders to easily add their own content to the game, while making sure there aren't any conflicts from different mods adding similar things.

## Features
- Adding or modifying any of the following types of content:
  - Cards
  - Artifacts
  - Components
  - Packs
  - Items
  - Pilots
  - Spells
  - Modifiers
- Importing custom sprites to replace existing sprites OR use for new items
- Custom tasks to allow new actions in encounters that wouldn't be possible with vanilla tasks

## Installation
The mod helper requires MelonLoader 0.7.2 to be installed for the game. MelonLoader can be downloaded from [https://melonwiki.xyz/](https://melonwiki.xyz/). After installing MelonLoader, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Slaith12/SVModHelper/releases/latest) of the mod helper and place it in the “Mods” folder in your game folder.
